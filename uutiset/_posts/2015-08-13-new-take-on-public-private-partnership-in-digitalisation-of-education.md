tags: education

As the new core curriculum for Finnish basic education is put in practice in autumn 2016, new pedagogic thinking and a more comprehensive take on the digital world require easy access for education providers to digital tools. The EduCloud Alliance consortium was initiated by the Ministry of Education and Culture to support digitalisation of education by removing obstacles for schools to make use of digital products and services. It represents a new take on private-public partnership where the state acts as a convener of parties to find win-win solutions that benefit all.

Members of the EduCloud Alliance consortium include publishing companies, ICT companies, learning managements system providers, start-ups, NGOs and the Ministry of Education and Culture. The aim of the consortium is to jointly agree on a de facto open standard (ECA) that will support the creation of an ecosystem of digital content, services and tools that are attainable, searchable, comparable and easy to purchase and take into use in education.

According to the founding document of the EduCloud Alliance the consortium aims to:

* Enhance the digitalisation and evolvement of the education sector
* Enhance cooperation of the education sector in the spirit of openness
* Create possibilities and enhance education export and to act as an gate opener for internationalisation efforts
* Enhance the creation of a national centralised user control and authentication solution
* Develop and steer the national service architecture to support standardised education sector services
* Define the architecture of components and complementing components of the ECA standard, including the architecture of an example implementation of the standard
* Develop an example implementation of the standard for validation and demo purposes and as a portal for actual implementations of e-commerce sites and products
* Bring the definition of the ECA standard to such a state that a developer of an e-commerce site can create a site that is compliant to the standards and a content provider to create content that is compliant in all these sites
* Enhance in this way also production of commercial educational products and services, internationalization and business
